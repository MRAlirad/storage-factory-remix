# Storage Factory

In this section, we'll work with three new contracts:

1. `SimpleStorage.sol` - the contract we build in the previous section, with some modifications
2. `AddFiveStorage.sol` - a child contract of `SimpleStorage` that leverages _inheritance_
3. `StorageFactory.sol` - a contract that will _deploy_ a `SimpleStorage` contract and _interact_ with it

### Section overview

```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
    SimpleStorage[] public listOfSimpleStorageContracts;

    function createSimpleStorageContract() public {};
    function sfStore(uint256 _simpleStorageIndex, uint256 _simpleStorageNumber) public {};
    function sfGet(uint256 _simpleStorageIndex) public view returns (uint256) {}
}
```

After deploying `StorageFactory` and executing its function `createSimpleStorageContract`, we can observe a new transaction appear in the Remix terminal. It's a **deployment transaction** of the `SimpleStorage` contract, executed by the `StorageFactory` contract.

It's possible to interact with this newly deployed `SimpleStorage` via the `store` function. We'll do this by using the **`sfStore`** function from the `StorageFactory` contract. This function accepts two parameters: the index of a deployed `SimpleStorage` contract, which will be '0' since we just deployed one contract, and the value of a `favoriteNumber`.

The **`sfGet`** function, when given the input '0', will indeed return the number provided by the previous function. The **address** of the `SimpleStorage` contract can then be retrieved by clicking on the get function `listOfSimpleStorageContracts`.

## Setting the project

In this `StorageFactory` setup, we'll explore what _composability_ means, showing its ability to deploy and interact with external `SimpleStorage` contracts.

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT** <br />
> One of the fundamental aspects of blockchain development is the seamless and permissionless interaction between contracts, known as [**`composability`**](https://chain.link/techtalks/defi-composability). This is particularly crucial in decentralized finance (DeFi), where complex financial products interact effortlessly through common smart contract interfaces.

Let's set up the backbone of the code, that contains the function `createSimplestorageContract`. This function will deploy a `SimpleStorage` contract and save the result into a _storage variable_:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract StorageFactory {

    function createSimplestorageContract() public {
        // How does StorageFactory know what SimpleStorage looks like?
    }
}
```

We need to establish a connection between the two contracts, since `StorageFactory` needs to have a complete knowledge of `SimpleStorage`. One first approach could be copying the `SimpleStorage` contract above `StorageFactory`.

> 🗒️ **NOTE** <br />
> It's allowed to have multiple contracts in the same file. As best practice, however, it's recommended to use only one file for each contract

> 💡 **TIP** <br />
> You can avoid confusion by keeping open **only** the file(s) you're currently working on.

## Deploying a contract from a contract

This lesson covers the process of **programmatically deploying** a `SimpleStorage` contract and saving it to a _storage or state variable_. By the end of this lesson, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how one contract can seamlessly deploy and manage another one.

### Creating a new variable

Following the format _type-visibility-name_, we can declare a new _state variable_ of type `SimpleStorage`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract StorageFactory {
    SimpleStorage public simpleStorage;

    function createSimplestorageContract() public {
        simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
    }
}
```

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT** <br /> > `SimpleStorage` on the left and `simpleStorage` on the right are treated as entirely distinct entities due to their differing capitalization. `Simple Storage` refers to the contract type while `simpleStorage` refers to the variable name.

When the `new` keyword is used, the compiler recognizes the intention to deploy a new contract instance. After compiling, we can proceed to deploy it.

In Remix, you'll then notice two buttons: an orange `createSimpleStorageContract` and a blue one, `SimpleStorage`, generated by the `public` keyword. If we call both, first `createSimpleStorageContract` and then `SimpleStorage`, the address that appears below confirms that our `SimpleStorage` contract has been deployed.

## Solidity Imports

The `import` keyword enables a contract to utilize code from other files without needing to include the entire codebase directly within the contract. Here are two of the main advantages that the `import` keyword provides:

1. **No cluttering**: it prevents your current file from being cluttered with numerous lines of code, keeping it clean and organized.
2. **Simplified maintenance**: by keeping the code in separate files, it becomes easier to maintain and update individual components without affecting the entire codebase. For example, if we change some lines inside `SimpleStorage`, we would have also to constantly copy-paste the modified content into `StorageFactory`

You can now remove the previously added `SimpleStorage` code and replace it with the `import` shorthand:

```solidity
import "./SimpleStorage.sol";
```

> 🚧 **WARNING** <br />
> All the solidity contracts should be compiled together using the _same compiler version_. It's important to ensure **consistency** between compiler versions across files since each one will have its own `pragma` statement.

### Named Imports

Let's assume for a moment that `SimpleStorage` would contain multiple contracts, e.g. `SimpleStorage`, `SimpleStorage1`, `SimpleStorage2`, which are quite extensive in size. If we import the whole file as we did before, the statement will replace the `import` directive with _all_ the code contained in `SimpleStorage.sol`. This will result in an unnecessary expensive deployment of the `StorageFactory` contract.

This can be prevented with **named imports**, which allow you to selectively import only the specific contracts you intend to use:

```solidity
import { SimpleStorage } from "./SimpleStorage.sol";
```

You can also use named imports to import multiple contracts:

```solidity
import { SimpleStorage, SimpleStorage1 } from "./SimpleStorage.sol";
```

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT** <br />
> Try to always default to named imports instead of importing the entire file.

## Intracting with contrracts ABI

In this lesson, the `StorageFactory` contract will be upgraded to _keep track_ of all deployed `SimpleStorage` contracts. This will allow us also to _interact_ with each deployed contract individually.

### Storing the deployed contracts

In the current `StorageFactory` version, every time `createSimpleStorageContract` is called, a new `SimpleStorage` contract is deployed and **overridden** inside the variable `SimpleStorage`. Past deployments are not being tracked down.

To solve this issue we can create a variable `listOfSimpleStorageContracts`, which is an array of `SimpleStorage` contracts. In this way, whenever a contract is created, it gets added to a dynamic array.

```solidity
SimpleStorage[] public listOfSimpleStorageContracts;
```

We can then modify the function `createSimpleStorageContract`, pushing the newly deployed contract to this variable.

```solidity
function createSimpleStorageContract() public {
    SimpleStorage simpleStorageContractVariable = new SimpleStorage();
    listOfSimpleStorageContracts.push(simpleStorageContractVariable);
}
```

In Remix, you can access `listOfSimpleStorageContracts` via the index of type `uint256`, which refers to the **position** of the deployed contract inside the dynamic array.

### Simple Storage interaction

`StorageFactory` can interact with the deployed contracts by calling their `store` function. To do this we need to create a **function** `sfStore`:

```solidity
function sfStore(uint256 _simpleStorageIndex, uint256 _simpleStorageNumber) public {
    //SimpleStorage store function will be called here
}
```

> 👀❗**IMPORTANT** <br />
> Every time you have to interact with another contract, you need:
>
> 1. the contract **address**
> 2. the contract **ABI (Application Binary Interface)**: a standardized way for interacting with the binary version of a smart contract deployed on the blockchain. It specifies the functions, their parameters, and the structure of the data that can be used to interact with the contract. It's generated by the compiler.

> 🗒️ **NOTE** <br />
> If you do not have the full ABI available, a function selector will suffice (see later in the course).

If you go to Solidity's compile tab, you will find a button that lets you copy the ABI to the clipboard.

> 🗒️ **NOTE** <br />
> In Solidity, it's possible to **type cast** an _address_ to a type _contract_

We can now proceed to store a new number on a `SimpleStorage` contract:

```solidity
function sfStore(uint256 _simpleStorageIndex, uint256 _simpleStorageNumber) public {
    listOfSimpleStorageContracts[_simpleStorageIndex].store( _simpleStorageNumber);
}
```

We can then retrieve the stored value with a _get_ function:

```solidity
function sfGet(uint256 _simpleStorageIndex) public view returns (uint256) {
        // return SimpleStorage(address(simpleStorageArray[_simpleStorageIndex])).retrieve();
        return listOfSimpleStorageContracts[_simpleStorageIndex].retrieve();
    }
```

## Inheritance in Solidity

In this lesson, we are going to introduce the concept of **inheritance** and **overriding**, two powerful tools that allow developers to create more modular, maintainable, and reusable smart contracts. By leveraging these techniques, you can build upon existing contracts and customize their functions.

### Inheritance

We are going to enhance the `SimpleStorage` contract by adding a new functionality: the ability to add five (5) to the stored `favoriteNumber`.
To achieve this, we could duplicate the existing `SimpleStorage` contract and make changes to the new version. However, this approach leads to redundant code. A better practice could be to utilize **inheritance**, which is the mechanism that allows the `AddFiveStorage` contract to derive all the functionalities of `SimpleStorage`.

Let's begin by creating a new file `AddFiveStorage.sol` and name-importing `SimpleStorage.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
import {SimpleStorage} from "./SimpleStorage.sol";

contract AddFiveStorage is SimpleStorage {}
```

The `is` keyword signifies inheritance and links the parent contract `SimpleStorage` to its child contract, `AddFiveStorage`.

### Override and virtual

The `AddFiveStorage` contract now inherits all methods from `SimpleStorage`. It's possible to add new functions to it, for example:

```solidity
function sayHello() public pure returns(string memory) {
    return "Hello";
}
```

We can also modify existing functions from `SimpleStorage` by using the **`override`** keyword. Let's say that we want to modify the `store` function, adding '5' to the favorite number being stored. If we copy the exact signature of the `store` function, an error will occur:

```solidity
function store(uint256 _newFavNumber) public {}
```

```Solidity
TypeError: Overriding function is missing "override" specifier.
```

> 🗒️ **NOTE**:br
> To override a method from the parent contract, we must replicate the exact function **signature**, including its name, parameters and adding the visibility and the `override` keyword to it:

```solidity
function store(uint256 _newFavNumber) public override {}
```

Yet, another error will pop up:

```Solidity
TypeError: Trying to override a non-virtual function.
```

To address this, we need to mark the `store` function in `SimpleStorage.sol` as **virtual**, enabling it to be overridden by child contracts:

```solidity
function store(uint256 favNumber) public virtual {
    // function body
}
```

Finally, we can add the new functionality to the `store` function in `AddFiveStorage`, allowing it to add '5' to the stored `favoriteNumber`:

```solidity
function store(uint256 _newFavNumber) public override {
    favoriteNumber = _newFavNumber + 5;
}
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we utilized inheritance to modify the `SimpleStorage` contract, without rewriting all its code. After deploying the contract `AddFiveStorage` and storing the number 2, it will return the `favoriteNumber` 7. This confirms that the `store` function in `AddFiveStorage` contract successfully overrides the existent `store` function in `SimpleStorage`.
